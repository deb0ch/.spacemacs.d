** PRs in progress
- Sudo save (https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SudoSave)
** Issue reports
- purpose: buffers in Conf[*] mode in 'general' instead of 'edit'
- Ranger: does not clean dired buffers (layer variables do not work)
- Multiple cursors: missing autoloads
- Multiple cursors: inserting newline leaves mode
- ycmd: strip flags that are not used for parsing (e.g. "-m" flags)
- Spacemacs: lazy install of c-c++ layer not working on CMakeLists.txt (on master)
** Bugs to fix
******* TODO frame jitter
** Contribution ideas
- user option for left-aligned responsive home buffer
- layout-local buffer navigation with ~SPC b n~ and ~SPC b p~
- Third Party Manager
- center cursor vertically when jumping around
- avy-*: case sensitivity by default (?)
- standardized helm actions
- home buffer: greeting message: tips, quotes.
*** bindings
- layouts state: bind ~l~ and ~w~ in both states
- workspaces state on ~SPC w w~
- workspace number on ~SPC w 1..9~
- smerge-mode
*** jump handlers
- add rtags to c++ layer (or wait for Quicknir's version)
- remove ycmd from jump handlers
**** location-stack
***** check if not already implemented
- hook on jump handlers
- go-to-next-mark
- go-to-prev-mark
**** specialized handlers
- go to dwim
- go to definition
- go to declaration
- go to references
*** coding style pain point
**** Variables to set:
- tab-width
- c-basic-offset
**** dtrt-indent dotfile option
**** coding-style layer ?

* Packages
** compilation
- fix: sometimes files don't open on click
*** hook =Bear= to compile command
- opt-in option ?
- requires third party manager ?
- requires 32bit AND 64bit libear.so ?
** emacs-ycmd
- allow for languages not supported by ycmd to use the
  =/filter_and_sort_candidates= request to get fuzzy-matching and ycmd ranking.
  See http://micbou.github.io/ycmd/.
** helm
- follow mode to set by default with =helm-ag-use-temp-buffer= set to t
- temporarily maximize window when following
- Helm-ag: make output look like helm-swoop (followed, grouped)
- Helm-M-x: add show-doc action
- Helm-swoop: unselect region before moving
- Helm-swoop: option to appear on the side
- helm-mini: fix truncated buffer names
******* TODO adjust size to contents when popping on the side
** layouts
- add to current layout non-useless buffers created in this layout (like magit
  or term buffers)
- do not filter buffers as useless if they were added to the current layout
** magit
- git blame color ids per commit
** magit-blame
- background color per commit
** multiple cursors
- multiple-cursors: fix RET should not leave mode
- evilify
** ranger
- major mode syntax coloring in preview buffer
** semantic
- fix echo area conflicts
- extract stickyfunc to use it with other backends
** smartparens
- brace arround region right
** spaceline
- lines count instead of buffer size
******* TODO responsive spaceline
Give each segment a priority.
0 is the highest priority.
If no priority given, set it to the lowest.
Only recompute mode-line on window width change.
Either use window-change-hook or check for window width change on every
mode-line evaluation.
******* TODO ycmd status
Show in the spaceline ycmd's status for current buffer and, more importantly, a
colored indication about finding the file in the compilation database:
green  -> found
orange -> replacement file found (show file pathname when mouse hovering)
red    -> db not found
*** remove `windows / unix`
- replace with `CRLF/CR` or disable completely
- remove useless '|'
** term, ansi-term, multi-term
- clean up `SPC '` term buffer after exiting with `C-d`
- fix `C-arrow` moves
- fix `M-backspace`
- fix zsh menucomplete covered by modeline
- fix char-mode / line-mode keybindings
** which-key
- popup help instead of echo area for help docstrings

* My spacemacs
** completion
*** Explore
**** packages
- rtags
**** header finders
- https://github.com/Rip-Rip/clang_complete/blob/master/bin/cc_args.pyi
** configs
- scroll: keep cursor 2 lines away from window ends
** daemon mode
- with-editor (or other): when in internal terminal, make command `ne` open files in current instance.
*** set environment
- launch daemon at startup (integrate to systemd ?)
- set EDITOR and other variables in .zshrc
- set relevant aliases in .zshrc
** legacy
- tty-format: display colors in log files
*** keybindings
- helm-projectile-ag to ~SPC p s~

* Packages to try
- calfw           (https://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-calfw)
- compile-bookmarks
- guess-style
- fuzzy-format
- editor-config (https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-emacs)
