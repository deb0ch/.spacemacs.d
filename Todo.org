** Contribution ideas
- user option for left-aligned responsive home buffer
- layout-local buffer navigation with ~SPC b n~ and ~SPC b p~
- Third Party Manager
- center cursor vertically when jumping around
- avy-*: case sensitivity by default (?)
- standardized helm actions
- home buffer: greeting message: tips, quotes...
*** bindings
- layouts state: bind ~l~ and ~w~ in both states
- workspaces state on ~SPC w w~
- workspace number on ~SPC w 1..9~
*** jump handlers
- add rtags to c++ layer (or wait for Quicknir's version)
- remove ycmd from jump handlers
**** location-stack
***** check if not already implemented
- hook on jump handlers
- go-to-next-mark
- go-to-prev-mark
**** specialized handlers
- go to dwim
- go to definition
- go to declaration
- go to references
*** coding style pain point
**** Variables to set:
- tab-width
- c-basic-offset
**** dtrt-indent dotfile option
**** coding-style layer ?
** PRs in progress
